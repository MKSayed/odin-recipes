  Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut."
  The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito,
  which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
